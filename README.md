Welcome to the official repository for my personal portfolio website. This project serves as a live, interactive resume and a showcase for my web development projects and skills. It is currently under active development.

## About The Project

This portfolio is designed from the ground up to be a clean, modern, and responsive platform to detail my professional background and technical abilities. The development process itself is a demonstration of best practices, including version control, automated CI/CD pipelines, and a phased development strategy starting with a front-end MVP.

## Tech Stack

The project is being built with a modern and scalable technology stack:

* **Frontend:**
    * **React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    * **TypeScript** - For strong typing and improved developer experience.
    * **Vite** - A next-generation frontend tooling for a blazing fast development experience.
    * **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
    * **Flowbite React** - An open-source component library built on top of Tailwind CSS.
* **Backend (Planned):**
    * **Node.js** with **Express** - For the server-side API.
    * **PostgreSQL** - As the relational database.
* **DevOps & Testing:**
    * **Vitest** & **React Testing Library** - For robust unit and component testing.
    * **Docker** - For containerizing the application for consistent deployments.
    * **GitHub Actions** - For automating the CI/CD pipeline (linting, testing, building).

## Key Features

This repository demonstrates a professional approach to modern web development:

* **Automated CI/CD:** Every push to `main` triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically lints, builds, and runs the entire test suite.
* **Test-Driven Principles:** The project is configured with Vitest for unit testing and includes a coverage threshold of 80% to ensure code quality and reliability.
* **Protected `main` Branch:** Direct pushes to the `main` branch are blocked. All changes must go through a pull request, ensuring code is reviewed and passes all automated checks before being merged.
* **Scalable Architecture:** The project is structured with separate `frontend` and (future) `backend` directories, anticipating a full-stack architecture.
